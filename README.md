# Matches-Celebrity-Faces
This project focuses on detecting face images and matching them with similar celebrity images using a Deep Learning model. By leveraging advanced techniques in computer vision, we can accurately identify faces in query images and find the closest matches among a database of celebrity images.

<h1>Overview</h1>

The ability to detect and match faces is essential in various applications, including biometrics, security systems, and entertainment. This project aims to develop a Deep Learning model capable of detecting face images and performing accurate celebrity matching based on visual similarity.

<h1>Face Detection and Recognition</h1>

To detect faces in images, we utilize a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model, specifically the VGG-Face model. VGG-Face is a pre-trained CNN model specifically designed for face recognition tasks. By leveraging its powerful architecture, we can extract facial features and detect faces with high accuracy.

Once the faces are detected, we proceed with the task of matching them with similar celebrity images. We employ the concept of cosine similarity, a measure that quantifies the similarity between two vectors. By comparing the facial features of query images with those of celebrity images, we can calculate the cosine similarity score to determine the closest matches.

<h1>Conclusion</h1>

This project successfully develops a Deep Learning model for face image detection and celebrity matching. By utilizing the CNN VGG-Face model, we achieve accurate face detection in query images. Additionally, by leveraging cosine similarity, we can identify similar celebrity images based on visual features.

The model's ability to detect faces and perform celebrity matching has various applications, including entertainment, social media, and personalized recommendation systems. It opens up possibilities for face recognition and identification in diverse domains.

Moving forward, this model can be deployed in real-world scenarios where face detection and celebrity matching are required. It can provide valuable insights and enhance user experiences by accurately identifying faces and finding relevant celebrity matches based on visual similarity.
